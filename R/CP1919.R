#' EIGHTY SUCCESSIVE PERIODS of the first pulsar observed, CP1919
#' (Cambridge pulsar at 19 hours 19 minutes right ascension), are
#' stacked on top of one another using the average period of 1.33730
#' seconds in this computer-generated illustration produced at the
#' Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico. Although the leading edges
#' of the radio pulses occur within a few thousandths of a second of
#' the predicted times, the shape of the pulses is quite irregular.
#' Some of this irregularity in radio reception is caused by the
#' effects of transmission through the interstellar medium.
#' The average pulse width is less than 50 thousandths of a second."
